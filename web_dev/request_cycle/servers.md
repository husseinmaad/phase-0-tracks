## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system? In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)?

> When Unix was being developed in the late 1960s, the developers were 
intent upon building an operating system that was significantly different from the
operating systems that preceded. 
The philosophy of Unix was markedly different from that 
of other operating systems. And the Linux philosophy is quite naturally derived directly
from the Unix philosophy.

*There are nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy.*

* Small is Beautiful
* Each Program Does One Thing Well
* Prototype as Soon as Possible
* Choose Portability Over Efficiency
* Store Data in Flat Text Files
* Use Software Leverage
* Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
* Avoid Captive User Interfaces
* Make Every Program a Filter
