# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** 

Define each of the following Git concepts.

1- **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**

Version control is tool allow us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people.
It's very useful to use the version control in order to its ability to track each change it was made, and to reverse changes to back to it when necessary

2- **What is a branch and why would you use one?**

The branch is a copy of your master code-base we used it to make the changes with messing with the main branch so we can edit/stage/commit and after that merge it with the master branch.

3- **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**

Commit is saved point in git or in another way records changes to the repository, help us to get back to the old version when we have some problems.  Good commit help us to understand what that save point about.

4- **What is a merge conflict?**

The merge conflict usually occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged and this is also meant that you have a commit in your current branch which are not in the other branch.
